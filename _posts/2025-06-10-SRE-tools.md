**If you're diving** into the world of Site Reliability Engineering or just trying to get a better grip on the tools SREs use every day, you're in the right place.

This post is a quick overview of 10 essential tools that help keep systems reliable, scalable, and running smoothly. From monitoring and alerting to infrastructure automation and incident response, these tools form the backbone of modern reliability work.

But we are not stopping with just a list. This is the starting point for a full series. Each tool featured here will get its own dedicated blog post where I break down the basics, show you how to get started, and share some real-world use cases. Whether you're completely new to these tools or just looking to brush up, this series is meant to make things clear, approachable, and practical.

So take a scroll through, get familiar, and keep an eye out for the doggy paddle swims coming soon.

I am not here to throw a bunch of jargon at you or assume you already know everything. The goal is to keep it clear, practical, and beginner friendly. Whether you are switching roles, just getting started in tech, or exploring SRE for the first time, welcome. This is the material I wish I had been introduced to earlier.**

## 1. Prometheus

An open-source monitoring system with a powerful query language called PromQL, Prometheus collects and stores time series data to help engineers track system performance and reliability. It uses a pull-based model to scrape metrics from targets, which makes it highly flexible in cloud-native environments.

Prometheus is especially strong in Kubernetes ecosystems where dynamic service discovery is critical.

Grafana is a flexible dashboard and visualization tool that works seamlessly with Prometheus and other data sources to provide real-time insights and alerting. It allows teams to build highly customized dashboards that translate raw metrics into something visually understandable.

With support for plugins and multiple data sources, Grafana becomes a central visibility hub for engineering teams.

## 3. Terraform

A popular Infrastructure-as-Code tool created by HashiCorp, Terraform allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure in a consistent and version-controlled way. Instead of clicking through cloud consoles, you describe infrastructure declaratively in code and let Terraform reconcile the desired state.

Terraform reduces configuration drift and makes infrastructure changes reviewable just like application code.

## 4. Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on top of VS Code that helps developers write, refactor, and understand code faster. It integrates large language models directly into your workflow, allowing you to ask questions about your codebase, generate functions, debug issues, and iterate without constantly switching contexts.

In practice, Cursor acts like a real-time pair programmer that accelerates development while keeping you in control. It can summarize large files, explain unfamiliar code paths, and suggest improvements without removing developer oversight.

A leading incident response platform, PagerDuty helps SRE teams manage on-call rotations, alerts, and postmortem reporting to improve incident response times. It ensures the right engineer is notified at the right time using schedules and escalation policies.

By centralizing alerts and communication, PagerDuty brings structure and accountability to high-pressure situations.

A full-stack observability platform that helps engineers monitor application performance, infrastructure, logs, and user experiences in real time. It connects metrics, traces, and logs into a unified view so teams can identify root causes quickly.

With proactive alerting and performance baselines, New Relic shifts teams from reactive firefighting to preventative reliability work.

## 7. Datadog

![Datadog Logo](/assets/images/blog2025/0622/datadog.png)

A cloud-native monitoring and analytics platform that offers deep integrations across infrastructure, logs, traces, and metrics within a single interface. Datadog excels at correlating data across services, which makes troubleshooting distributed systems more manageable.

Datadog's SaaS model also reduces the operational overhead of running your own monitoring stack.

## 8. Git

![Git Logo](/assets/images/blog2025/0622/Git_icon.png)

Git is the de facto version control system for managing code, infrastructure, and configuration changes with traceability and collaboration in mind. It allows teams to branch, merge, and revert safely without losing historical context.

For SREs, Git becomes the foundation of infrastructure-as-code, automation workflows, and change management.

## 9. GitHub Actions

![GitHub Actions Logo](/assets/images/blog2025/0622/GitHub-Mark.png)

GitHub Actions provides native CI/CD capabilities directly within GitHub, allowing teams to automate, test, and deploy code based on GitHub events. Workflows are defined in YAML and triggered by actions such as pushes, pull requests, or releases.

GitHub Actions integrates tightly with repositories, making automation part of the development lifecycle instead of a separate system.

## 10. Rundeck

![Rundeck Logo](/assets/images/blog2025/0622/rundeck_logo_white.png)

Rundeck is an open-source operations management platform that enables self-service automation, runbook automation, and orchestration of routine processes. It allows teams to safely delegate operational tasks without granting full server access.

By turning scripts into controlled, auditable jobs, Rundeck reduces repetitive work and lowers operational risk.
