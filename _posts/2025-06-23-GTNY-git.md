**It's time for Git.** I'm saying this as an intervention. Do not argue with me about it. Do not yell at me for where it's at on this list. We are saying this because we love you... it's Git time.

The reason I placed it here is because you need your team and basic processes in the right place before Git (in my opinion). There is a learning curve and it is a lot easier when SRE's start discovering the benefits, ease, complexity, and headache together as a team. I recommend creating a blameless beginners environment where everyone uses Git at least locally.

But, believe me, DO NOT PASS THIS POINT UNTIL YOU HAVE GIT IN PLACE.

**So, let’s talk about Git**—Not describing a person as a jerk (kinda), the tool. If you’ve worked in software, chances are someone told you to “just push it to Git.” It sounds simple enough until you're staring at the terminal wondering if `git reset --hard` is going to destroy your entire project.

Git is the backbone of modern software collaboration. It’s a version control system, but it’s also a safety net, a collaboration platform, and a historical archive of every bad idea you rolled back from. Whether you're shipping features, fixing bugs, or rolling back a hot mess—Git's the tool keeping track of it all.

But let’s clear something up right away: **Git and GitHub are not the same thing.**

Git is the open-source version control system—the engine that tracks your changes, branches, merges, and commits. You can use Git entirely on your local machine without ever touching the internet. It’s distributed, so every clone is a full backup.

**GitHub**, on the other hand, is a cloud platform that *hosts* Git repositories and adds collaboration features on top. Think of it as a social network for Git projects—with issues, pull requests, project boards, discussions, and integrations. Other platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket do the same thing, just with different spins.

If Git is your toolbox, GitHub is your workshop.

I’m not here to throw jargon at you or assume you know it all. The goal is to keep it practical, simple, and clear. Whether you're switching roles, starting your tech journey, or just SRE-curious—welcome. This is the stuff I wish someone explained to me.

## Why Git?

Git gives you version history, the ability to work with others without breaking stuff, and tools to experiment without fear. It's fast, reliable, and used everywhere—from solo side projects to massive enterprise deployments.

For SREs, Git isn’t just about code. We store our Terraform configs, Kubernetes manifests, documentation, and incident reports in Git. It lets us automate changes, track who did what, and revert things when they go sideways.

It also plays a key role in CI/CD pipelines. Triggering deploys from commits, tagging releases, or logging incident responses—all of that starts with Git. Without it, collaboration becomes chaos.

And when it comes to collaboration, GitHub (or similar platforms) brings everything together. From reviewing code to opening issues, tagging teammates, and kicking off automated tests, your Git workflow lives in these platforms. But the underlying foundation—the versioning, branching, and history—that’s all Git.

## A Real Story: How Git Helped My Team

At the small company I joined right out of school, we didn’t use version control at all in the beginning. I’m talking no Git, no Subversion—nothing. We were literally chatting and emailing scripts back and forth. Sometimes, we’d even walk over to each other’s desks to go over code. It’s kind of wild to think about now.

As the company grew, we realized how unsustainable that was. So we rolled out Git. Suddenly, our collaboration leveled up. We could track what changed, who changed it, and when. We started using Bitbucket for remote collaboration, and things just clicked. We stopped overwriting each other’s work and started building things the right way.

Then the pandemic hit, and everyone went remote. Thanks to Git and Bitbucket, we didn’t miss a beat. Code reviews, branching strategies, merges—it all just worked. Having that system in place made the transition smooth and gave us some much-needed sanity when everything else felt chaotic.

## Benefits

- **History & Traceability**  
  Every change is logged. You know who changed what, when, and why.

- **Safe Collaboration**  
  Work on the same codebase without stepping on each other’s toes.

- **Branching & Experimentation**  
  Create branches to test new ideas or fixes without breaking production.

- **Audit-Ready**  
  Perfect for compliance, debugging, and reviewing long-term changes.

- **Integrations Everywhere**  
  Git hooks into CI/CD, ticketing systems, cloud platforms—you name it.

- **Offline Capable**  
  You can commit, branch, and view history without an internet connection.

- **Platform Flexibility**  
  Use Git locally or pair it with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or other tools.

---

## Drawbacks

- **Steep Learning Curve**  
  The CLI can be intimidating. Commands like `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, and `stash` can feel like wizardry.

- **Merge Conflicts**  
  Conflicts happen when people edit the same file. They’re fixable, but annoying.

- **Overkill for Tiny Projects**  
  If you’re tracking a single script or a throwaway file, Git might feel like too much setup.

- **Too Many Tools**  
  Git is just the engine. Choosing between GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. can be overwhelming.

- **Bad Git Hygiene Can Haunt You**  
  Forget to commit regularly? Pushing broken changes to `main`? Git is powerful, but unforgiving if used poorly.

## Cost

Git itself is free and open-source. Hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket offer free tiers with generous limits for individuals and small teams.

If you need private repos, enterprise features, or self-hosting, there are paid plans—but you can get really far without ever opening your wallet.

---

## Bottom Line

Git is a must-know tool for anyone in tech. Whether you're writing code, managing infrastructure, or just keeping notes—Git helps you stay organized and in control.

If you’ve ever wanted an “undo” button for your project work—this is it.

Stay tuned for the next tool in the **Git to Know You** series!
