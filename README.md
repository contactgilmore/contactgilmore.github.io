# Mike Gilmore – Portfolio & SRE/DevOps Blog

Welcome to my portfolio site: a place where I showcase my work as a **Site Reliability Engineer**, **DevOps practitioner**, and lifelong learner.

This site highlights:
- 🔧 Tools I use and trust
- 📈 Projects that solve real problems
- 🧠 Lessons from working across infrastructure, support, and cloud environments

One of the standout features is my ongoing blog series, **[Git to Know You](https://contactgilmore.github.io)**—a beginner-friendly, tool-focused deep dive into the technologies that make up a modern SRE toolkit.
