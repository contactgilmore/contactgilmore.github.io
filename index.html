              This is where I share what I’m building, automating, and learning across cloud architecture,
              observability,
              DevOps tooling, reliability engineering, and sales engineering. Most of it comes from real projects,
              production lessons, and the occasional deep dive into something that annoyed me enough to fix.
            </p>

            <p>
              You’ll find write-ups on infrastructure decisions, monitoring strategies, and automation workflows, but
              also
              how I approach technical discovery, solution design, and explaining tradeoffs to different audiences. I
              care
              about systems that are reliable, understandable, and efficient, and I’m big on documentation that actually
              helps the next person.
            </p>

            <p>
              This site is part of that process. It’s built with Jekyll plus custom HTML and CSS. I was skeptical at
              first,
              but once I got the structure dialed in, it became a straightforward way to publish work without fighting
              the
              tooling.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m always updating this with projects, experiments, and demo-style writeups that show how I think and how
              I
              communicate. The blog is where I go deeper and capture the decisions behind the work.

      <div class="about-section-content">
        <div class="body-text">
          <p>
            I design and support cloud systems that need to perform reliably under real-world pressure. My work spans
            cloud architecture, DevOps, and site reliability engineering, with a strong focus on observability,
            automation, and infrastructure that is maintainable at scale.
          </p>

          <p>
            In parallel, I bring a sales engineering mindset to technical problems. I am comfortable leading discovery,
            clarifying ambiguous requirements, and translating complex distributed systems into clear, outcome-focused
            conversations for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            Earlier in my career, I led customer-facing technical teams in retail operations. That experience shaped how
            I work today. I value calm decision-making, structured problem solving, and communication that builds trust.
            Technical depth matters, but so does making sure teams and customers understand the system and can operate
            it
            confidently.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether I am refining alerting strategy, building infrastructure as code, running a proof of concept, or
            guiding a post-incident review, the goal is the same: reduce ambiguity, increase clarity, and leave systems
            and teams stronger than I found them.

                I bring a mix of reliability engineering and sales engineering. I can go deep on cloud architecture,
                automation, and observability, and I can also run technical discovery, translate customer needs into
                clear requirements, and present solutions in a way that builds confidence.
              </p>

              <h3>Sales Engineering Strengths</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Discovery and scoping:</strong> Requirements gathering, clarifying constraints, and aligning
                  on success criteria and value.</li>
                <li><strong>Demos and PoCs:</strong> Building tailored workflows that map to customer use cases and
                  proving technical fit.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution architecture:</strong> Designing AWS and Azure approaches with practical tradeoffs
                  in security, scale, and operability.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrations:</strong> Working through REST APIs, automation, and identity patterns like
                  SSO, SAML, and OIDC.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Explaining complex systems in plain language, handling objections,
                  and presenting clearly to technical and non-technical audiences.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Reliability and Cloud Engineering Strengths</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as code:</strong> Terraform and CloudFormation for repeatable environments
                  and reduced drift.</li>
                <li><strong>Containers and orchestration:</strong> Docker and Kubernetes (EKS) with an operations-first
                  mindset.</li>
                <li><strong>Observability:</strong> Metrics, logs, dashboards, and alerting that reduce noise and
                  improve incident response.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations:</strong> On-call readiness, incident management, postmortems, and durable
                  runbooks.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and compliance:</strong> IAM, access control, SSL and certificate workflows, SOC 2
                  style requirements.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Core Technologies</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud:</strong> AWS (EC2, EKS, S3, RDS, IAM, CloudFormation), Azure (VNet, VM, Migrate),
                  limited GCP exposure</li>
                <li><strong>Automation and delivery:</strong> Terraform, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, Argo CD</li>
                <li><strong>Ops tooling:</strong> PagerDuty, Jira (Kanban), Slack, New Relic</li>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, PowerShell, C#, SQL</li>
                <li><strong>Systems:</strong> Linux (Ubuntu), Windows Server, macOS</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The theme across all of this is the same: I reduce ambiguity. I turn messy technical situations into
                clear next steps, whether that is a production incident, a customer architecture question, or a demo
                that needs to prove value fast.
