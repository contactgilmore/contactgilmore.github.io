            This page is where I’ll be sharing things I’ve learned (and am still learning) about cloud architecture,
            observability, tooling, automation, and working smarter—not just harder. Expect a mix of tech deep-dives,
            war stories, and maybe the occasional strong opinion about HCL.
            
            I have been messing with different templates and changing things around. I did not like
            Jekyll much so here we are.
            I'll be playing around, updating, and adding my projects over the next few weeks. Currently, I'm working on
            this locally in my free time.
            
            The blog section I think will be the most fun as I can write about my experiences, projects, and things I
            learn along the way. Mainly the nerd stuff I like to do day to day.

        <div class="body-text">

          <p>I build and support systems that don’t fall over when things get weird—and I’ve been doing it long enough
            to know that weird is the norm. My background spans cloud engineering, DevOps, and site reliability, but
            honestly, what keeps me going is the puzzle-solving. I like digging into problems, fixing what’s broken, and
            finding better ways to do things—even if it means rewriting the map.</p>

          <p>Before I was an SRE, I led teams in the retail world, which taught me how to stay calm under pressure,
            connect with people, and actually listen—skills that ended up being just as valuable as learning Kubernetes.
            That blend of human and technical perspective has shaped how I work today: clear priorities, good
            communication, and steady execution (especially when the alerts won’t stop).</p>

          <p>Over the years, I’ve helped teams roll out global onboarding programs, simplify chaos with solid
            documentation, and get to the root of gnarly incidents. But the work I’m proudest of is the kind that makes
            life easier for the folks around me—whether that’s a teammate, a customer, or the next person on-call at
            2am.</p>
